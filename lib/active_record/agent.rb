module ActiveRecord #:nodoc:
  # == acts_as_agent
  # Agents are models that can perform actions in the application. The paradigm of Agents are Users.
  #
  # Using Station, any of the models of your application can have Agent features. Nevertheless, having
  # only one model called User is the most common configuration.
  #
  # Agent functionality is declared with ActsAsMethods#acts_as_agent
  #
  #   class User
  #     acts_as_agent :authentication => [ :login_and_password, :openid ],
  #                   :openid_server => true
  #   end
  #
  #
  # == Authentication
  # Agents must provide some credentials to the web application in order to identify themselves.
  #
  # Station provides several methods to do so, from classic login and password to modern {OpenID}[http://openid.net/]. You can configure which methods will be used as an option in acts_as_agent
  #
  # See Authentication module for methods supported.
  #
  # == Authorization
  # Station uses an avanced access control model called the Authorization Chain. This provides you
  # flexibility to enforce miscelaneus authorization policies. See Authorization for more insight.
  #
  # === RBAC
  # Station provides Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) functionality within the Authorization framework.
  #
  # One of the Authorization Blocks defined by Station has to do with Stages. Agents perform a Role
  # in each Stage they participate. This Role defines the permissions the Agent can perform in the
  # scope of this Stage.
  #
  # == Singular Agents
  # Singular Agents are special models with Agent features. Each one represents a paradigm:
  # * Anonymous: the Agent behind a request without authentication credentials.
  # * Anyone: represents any Agent instance.
  # * CronAgent: the time-based job scheduler in Unix-like computer operating systems.
